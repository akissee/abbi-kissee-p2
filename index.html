            <h2>SOO Good Compared To David Lynch's Dune</h2>
            <p>I have to say that although David Lynch's 1984 is unique it is not something I would put down in the history books. </p>

            <h2>Highly Recommended Piece of Art!</h2>
            <p>I've been a avid Dune fan, from the books to all the related movies. I love this new release, it gives big screen/big budget to the franchise without compromising the integrity of the story. A truly great work!</p>

            <h2>It was Okay...Not Quite What I Wanted.</h2>
            <p>Being a fan of the 1984 adaptation, I didn't love this new 'modern' version. The cast was good, however it just didn't have enough of the essence of the book world that I was looking for. </p>

            <h2>Improvement, but doesn't quite hit the mark. </h2>
            <p>So, from the outset, this film can't help but be better than the 1984 version. BUT, it manages to do something I didn't expect...it's actually TOO long...or so it felt due to the pacing and ridiculous number of big scenes were not much happens but you see a lot of eye candy...along with very moody music. In many ways, it reminded me of the first "Star Trek" movie...which was so long and tedious.</p>

            <h2>Lord of the Dune sand, we love you.</h2>
            <p>Denis Villeneuve is a director who I adore a lot. His weird and very strange movies that are like a punch in the gut and warrant multiple viewings to understand are one thing - but he has proven that he can also do blockbuster movies too.</p>

            <h2>"Dune" is a really new American movie from 2021</h2>
            <p>If this film was a planet, then it could be fine for temporary stay, permanent not really though.</p>

            <h2>Visual Affects are off the charts, lacks story...</h2>
            <p>It needed something to set the scene for us, to show us who the strong and the weak were. I'm not much for narration (show me, don't tell me), but it may not have been a bad idea. The scenes are magnificent with special effects off the chart. </p>
