Abbi Kissee's Project 2 for ITDEV 160-002

A webpage designed to be an editable monthly budget creator. This will allow the user to enter their income for the month and also input all of the monthly expenses. Then it will complete all the computations and display the information in a table outlining the budget for that month. It will allow you to input multiple months and see all the monthly totals listed. When each month is created they will be able to save it and it will save as a new tab on the page, so they can look through each month seperately.

There will be a welcome statement and a brief explaination to the user. Then they will be able to input the month, the income, and the expenses. Then the program will populate all the data into a table. Once the table is created the user will be able to click 'Save' or 'Submit' and this will save it into its own tab under monthly budgets. They can create more and then they will all be listed by the month. When the user clicks on the month they would like to view it will show that table with the data clearing out the previously viewed table.
