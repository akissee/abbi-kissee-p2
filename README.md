Abbi Kissee's Project 2 for ITDEV 160-002

A webpage designed to your one stop shop for Dune (2021) Movie reviews. The film just dropped and I wanted to create a page where you could read other peoples reviews of the movie as well as add your own post. I hope to have an image and a header that states the title of the page and features a "Create New Post" button as well as a logo.

There will be a header which will feature a "Create New Post" button which users can click on to pop up an input box where they can make a personalized review including a title, content, and name space. Once they select the save button on the input box they are then able to see their review show up on the page next in line with the others.
